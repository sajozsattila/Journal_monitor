      "We consider the asymptotic behavior of the following model: balls are sequentially thrown into bins so that the probability that a bin with  $n$  balls obtains the next ball is proportional to  $f(n)$  for some function  $f$ .  A commonly studied case where there are two bins and  $f(n) = n^p$  for  $p $ .  In this case, one of the two bins eventually obtains a monopoly, in the sense that it obtains all balls thrown past some point.  This model is motivated by the phenomenon of positive feedback, where the \"rich get richer.\"  We derive a simple asymptotic expression for the probability that bin 1 obtains a monopoly when bin 1 starts with  $x$  balls and bin 2 starts with  $y$  balls for the case  $f(n) = n^p$ .  We then demonstrate the effectiveness of this approximation with some examples and demonstrate how it generalizes to a wide class of functions  $f$ .\n"
